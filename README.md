# Enhancing Machine Translation with Speech and Textual Punctuation Features

This repo consists of data processing, baseline MT, punctuation feature extraction codes and E2E MT.

1) 1_Baseline_MT: contains simple mBART encoder - decoder
2) 2_Feature_Extraction: codes for only text, only speech and speech+text punctuation feature extraction models along with preprocessing.
3) 3_MT_models_text_speech_both: codes for E2E training of MT.
4) data: FLEURS dataset (english - telugu parallel)

The trained E2E MT model weights are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BChW7-TLEzTKtWsh154SPyWhTHG9qRbo?usp=sharing


All the translations are stored in the csv files in this folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yzUXDwxOxNJxL7kfe_8htXhtQcs0UP71?usp=sharing
